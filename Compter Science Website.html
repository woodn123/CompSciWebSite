<h1> What makes a good MLB offense? </h1> 
<p> Having a good offense in baseball is one way that you can help a team succeed. There are several factors that go into determining what makes a “good” offense. Some of these factors are batting average, on base percentage and home runs. These are just 3 of the several factors that go into making a good offense. </p>

<h2> Batting Average </h2>
<p>  Batting average is one of the most important statistics a team needs to keep. In terms of offense. It determines how often the hitter gets on base. Teams with better offenses will have a higher average and teams with worse batting will have lower averages. A team won’t win if it has practically no offense. There needs to be a strong supporting offense even if the team has a good defense. 


<h2> Some of the American League batting average leaders consist of: </h2>
<ol>
<li> Jose Altuve, Houston Astros, .338</li>
<li> Mookie Betts, Boston Red Sox, .318</li>
<li> Dustin Pedroia, Boston Red Sox, .318</li>
<li> Miguel Cabrera, Detroit Tigers, .316</li>
<li> Mike Trout, Los Angeles Angels, .315</li>

<h3> On Base Percentage </h3> 
<p> Another important factor to having a good offense is a team's “on base percentage.” This means literally what the name implies, it is how often hitters on that team will get on base; not just through hits but also from walks and the occasional reaching on an error. With more runners on base, it provides teams more opportunities to score.

<h3> Some of the National League "On Base Percentage Leaders" are </h3 >

<ol> 
<li> Joey Votto, Cincinatti Reds, .434</li>
<li> DJ LeMahieu, Colorado Rockies, .416</li>
<li> Paul Goldshmidt, Arizona Diamondbacks, .411</li>
<li> Freddie Freeman, Atlanta Braves, .400</li>
<li> Brandon Belt, San Francisco Giants, .394</li>

 <div class="hr">
<h2> Homeruns </h2> 

<p> Finally a factor that doesn’t hold a lot of importance but having people in your lineup that can do this is always a great thing to have. Home run hitters. People that consistently have the ability to hit the ball out of the park and drive in runs. Those who can put up 25+ home runs in a season and also being able to put the ball in play is something that a home run hitter should be able to do. 

<h2> Some of the 2016 MLB Homerun Leaders Are </h2>
<ol> 
<li> Mark Trumbo, Baltimore Orioles, 47 </li>
<li> Nelson Cruz, Seattle Mariners, 43 </li>
