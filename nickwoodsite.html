<h1> What makes a good MLB offense? </h1> 
<p> Having a good offense in baseball is one way that you can help a team succeed. There are several factors that go into determining what makes a “good” offense. Some of these factors are batting average, on base percentage and home runs. These are just 3 of the several factors that go into making a good offense. </p>

<h2> Batting Average </h2>
<p>  Batting average is one of the most important statistics a team needs to keep. In terms of offense. It determines how often the hitter gets on base. Teams with better offenses will have a higher average and teams with worse batting will have lower averages. A team won’t win if it has practically no offense. There needs to be a strong supporting offense even if the team has a good defense. 


<h3> Some of the player batting average leaders consist of: </h3>
<ol>
<li> Jose Altuve, Houston Astros, .338</li>
<li> Mookie Betts, Boston Red Sox, .318</li>
<li> Dustin Pedroia, Boston Red Sox, .318</li>
<li> Miguel Cabrera, Detroit Tigers, .316</li>
<li> Mike Trout, Los Angeles Angels, .315</li>
